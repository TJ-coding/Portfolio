<h2>Some context on Lorenz system</h2>
Lorenz system is a chaotic system that govern the trejectory of a particle with 3 differential equations.
<br><br>
So what is a chaotic system? By definition, a chaotic system is <b>sensitive to their initial condition</b>. In the case of a Lorenz system, the trejectory of a particle is sensitive to their initial position. This was a major discovery at the time since a chaotic ststem was not recorgnised at the time.
<br><br>
 Up until the discovery of Lorenz system, people had only worked with systems where small change in initaial condition resulted in a small resultant change. Observing a chaotic movement from a set of simple equations was unexpected. However, if we look at real life systems such as the weather and stock price, it is not so supprising to expect an erratic phenomena from a system governed by simple rules. 
<br><br>
 Some may say chaos is what make life beautiful since without it, everything can easily be predicted.
