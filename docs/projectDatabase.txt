	So what is chaos? By definition, a chaotic system is sensitive to their initial condition. In case of a Lorenz system the trejectory of a particle is sensitive to their initial position. This was a major discovery at the time since a chaotic ststem was not recorgnised at the time. Poeple had only worked with systems where variables had simple relations and observing such a chaotic movement from set of simple equation was unexpected. However, if we look at the world, it is obvious how system governed by simple euqations can cause an erratic phenomena, such the stock price or the weather.
